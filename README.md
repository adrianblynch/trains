# Trains

A first look at `creat-react-app` to see what all the fuss is about and a counter project to something I'm working on with Riot.

## Notes

- fecha - A lightweight date formatting lib.
- react-router - Version 4 with a manual fix for an [issue with multiple routes](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39529711/react-router-v4-with-babel-gives-error-with-multiple-routes).
- Flex - The project this is mimicking has to support IE9, so no Flexbox, I have no such restrictions.
- No Redux - Upon installing, I went to grab Redux. Instead I decided to leave it out.
- Data - Rather than doing a request for data, the search data is made available in JSON files.
- Data - It's not optimised for updating. It's nested more than it should be.
